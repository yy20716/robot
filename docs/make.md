# Makefile

On Unix platforms (including Mac OS X and Linux) you can use the venerable <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/" target="_blank">Make</a> tool to string together multiple `robot` commands. Make can also handle dependencies between build tasks.

    TODO make
    TODO make release

When working with Makefiles, be careful with whitespace! Make expects tabs in some places and spaces in others, and mixing them up will lead to unexpected results. Configure your text editor to indicate when tabs or spaces are being used.

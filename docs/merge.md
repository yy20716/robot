# Merge

OWL ontologies are often divided into several `.owl` files, with `owl:imports` statements to bring them together. Sometimes you want to take all those imports and merge them into a single ontology with a single `.owl` file.

    robot merge --input edit.owl --output results/merged.owl

You don't need `owl:import` statements: you can merge any number of ontologies by using multiple `--input` arguments. All the ontologies and their imports are merged into the first ontology.

    robot merge --input edit.owl --input foo.owl --output results/merged2.owl

A merge can be 'undone' with [unmerge](/unmerge).
